// TO DO
- Verify OpenAPI Swagger to see if makes sense

// IMPROVEMENTS
- Maybe use the queue for the rest of the API
- Somewhere in the app the group games should be updated to keep up with EXT API

// TESTS
- Automate Postman tests

// DUVIDAS

/// GLOBAL IDEA \\\
App allows users to create groups and add games to their own groups (only)
Users can hold groups from other users in their own personal groups
If the owner deletes a group then all the users which had that group in their groups list looses it as well
Users get an access token upon sign up which then is used to identify them inside the app
